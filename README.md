# calorie-counter
Simple app to count calories.<br>
This app is built with html/css and javascript
<br>
Once the application starts you will need to insert the amount of calories you want to consume.
Then you can record your calorie consumption with the buttons "+" (to add consumed calories), "-" (to remove excessive calories).
The progress will be shown on a dynamic circular bar.<br>
When you reach your goal the buttons will dissapear and you will have to refresh the page to use the app again.
